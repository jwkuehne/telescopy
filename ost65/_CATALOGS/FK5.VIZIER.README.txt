N.B. FK5 815 has 0.7, but HR 8303 is 2.39. The problem is that 815 is a variable
star ranging from 0.7 to 2.4, and has had notable flares.

Abstract:
    The Basic Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5) Part I provides improved
    mean positions and proper motions for the 1535 classical fundamental
    stars that had been included in the FK3 and FK4 catalogs. The machine
    version of the catalog contains the positions and proper motions of
    the Basic FK5 stars for the epochs and equinoxes J2000.0 and B1950.0,
    the mean epochs of individual observed right ascensions and
    declinations used to determine the final positions, the mean errors of
    the final positions and proper motions for the reported epochs, and
    ancillary data such as magnitudes, spectral types, parallaxes, radial
    velocities, and cross identifications to other catalog designations.

Introduction:
    The Basic FK5 is the successor to the FK4 (Fricke & Kopff 1963) and
    contains the 1535 classical fundamental stars used to define the
    latter system. It represents a revision of the FK4 and results from
    the determination of systematic and individual corrections to the mean
    positions and proper motions of the FK4, the elimination of the error
    in the FK4 equinox, and the introduction of the IAU (1976) system of
    astronomical constants. About 300 catalogs providing star positions
    obtained from throughout the world are included in the FK5. This
    document should be used only to supplement the information contained
    in the source reference. The latter should be consulted for more
    detailed information regarding the motivation for construction of the
    FK5, the determination of its equator and equinox, the expressions for
    general precession, a discussion of the FK5 system, systematic
    differences between the FK4 and FK5, the transformation of
    observational catalogs to the FK5 system and to the reference system
    J2000.0, and more thorough descriptions of the data contained in the
    FK5 catalog.

Note on FK5:
   These numbers have remained the same from the FK3 and FK4 (Catalog I/15).
   The user should note that the file is ordered by FK5 number, which
   means that the stars are arranged neither by right ascension nor by
   declination.
Note on RAs, RA1950s, DEs, DE1950s:
    The B1950.0 data have been computed from the J2000.0 data using a
    procedure described in the source reference (Fricke et al. 1988) 
    based on the IAU (1976) system of astronomical constants (see also 
    Lieske 1979), with elimination of the terms of elliptic aberration. 
    These positions are therefore expressed in the new system, for 
    epoch and equinox B1950.0
Note on EpRA-1900, EpDE-1900:
   Mean epoch (-1900.0) of the individual observed right ascensions and
   declinations.
Note on e_RAs and e_DEs:
   The mean errors of the positions at the mean epoch and of the
   corresponding proper-motion components, as obtained from the solution of
   the normal equations within the derivations of individual positions and
   proper motions. (These mean errors do not include those of the FK5
   system and of the equinox and equator.)
Note on Vmag:
   Photoelectric magnitudes on the UBV system, as taken from the catalogs
   of Nicolet (1975, 1978). Variability is indicated by a flag in byte 129.
   For physical double stars, the magnitudes of the brighter components are
   given (both are given in the published catalog).
Note on n_Vmag:
   Where magnitude ranges are given in the published catalog, the brighter
   magnitude is given and byte 129 contains an upper case "V". A lower case
   "v" is present if there is variability and that letter is present in the
   published catalog (amplitude exceeds 0.3mag). A "D" code indicates that
   the magnitudes of two close components are given as a footnote in the
   published catalog. Only the first of the two is contained in the
   magnitude field of the machine-readable catalog.
Note on SpType:
   A one-dimensional spectral type taken from the FK4 catalog. These types
   are from the Henry Draper Catalogue (Cannon & Pickering 1918-24). For
   binary and multiple systems where spectral types are known for more than
   one component, a second spectral type may be given following a plus
   sign.
Note on plx:
   Trigonometric parallax if known (blank otherwise). These data are
   taken from a preliminary version of the new Yale parallax catalog
   (van Altena, Lee, & Hoffleit, in preparation). Negative parallaxes
   present in the Yale catalog have been omitted here because they are
   of no use in computing apparent places from the mean positions.
Note on RV:
   Radial Velocity if known (blank otherwise)
Note on DM: the prefixes are
   BD:  Bonner Durchmusterung (Argelander 1859-62, Kuestner 1903 I/122)
   SD: Southern Durchmusterung (Schoenfeld 1886 I/119)
   CD: Cordoba Durchmusterung (Thome 1892- 1932 I/114)
   CP: Cape Photographic Durchmusterung (Gill and Kapteyn 1895-1900 I/108)


History:
   The following format changes were made by W. H. Warren Jr. (with Dr.
   Schwan's concurrence):
      The DM identifiers, which were single-digit numerical codes, were
         changed to the literal codes.
      Plus signs were added to the trigonometric-parallax data, even though
         no negative parallaxes are included in the catalog, to indicate
         that negative parallaxes are possible.
      Multiple blanks between data fields were removed, as were blanks
         beyond the end of each record, to decrease the logical record
         length from 220 bytes to 190 bytes.

Acknowledgments:
   Dr. H. Schwan kindly supplied the original and revised versions of the
   on magnetic tape and colleagues at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut
   generously reviewed a draft copy of the original documentation prior to
   its final release for distribution with machine-readable copies of the
   catalog, and Dr. Schwan returned comments and corrections. Appreciation
   is expressed to Dr. William M. Owen Jr. of JPL for supplying the
   machine-readable FK4, DM cross index that was used to insert DM numbers
   into the original version of the FK5 catalog.
